Image Segmentation:- Partioning image into set of pixels such that similar kind of pixels hold 
similar attributes and values.

Image Thresholding:-It is a type of image segmentation that converts a grayscale image into binary image.
Diffrent type of thresholding:-
1.Simple thresholding:- cv2.THRESH_BINARY :- if pixel< threshold_value:
                                                    pixel=0
                                              else  pixel=1
cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV:- if pixel< threshold_value:
                                                    pixel=1
                                              else  pixel=0
cv2.THRESH_TOZERO:-
                  if pixel < th     pixel=0
                  else pixel=pixel
cv2.THRESH_TOZERO_INV
                  if pixel<th        pixel=pixel
                   else pixel=th
2.Adaptive
3.OTSU's thresholding
Generally we use an arbitrary value as threholding value, to improve the
accurate selection of this thresholding value, we use otsu's thresholding
Biodal image(an image which histogram contains 2 peaks), so approximate 
threshold value as middle of both peak values.

function:- cv2.THRESH_OTSU()
ret,th = cv2.threshold(img,0,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY+cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
1st arg- image matrix
2nd arg- any random threshold value between 0 to 255
3rd arg- the value to be assigned if pixel value is more than threshold value
4th arg- thresholding function
ret- returned threshold value
th- thresholded image

Functioning of OTSU's Binarization:-
Calculate probability, mean and variance of t-thresholded images 
and minimize weigthed within class variance
  varw(t)=varf(t)*sumofpixels(1,t)+varb(t)*sumofpixels(t+1,n)
